## A simple HTML page with some cool gradient buttons. 

Creating this page was inspired by the challenge that I faced while I was working on the project for my company. This is simply my take on the problem that I had to solve.
Currently, gradients are not animatable in CSS, to it is always a bit of challenge to simulate such behavior, but I had a lot of fun doing it!
